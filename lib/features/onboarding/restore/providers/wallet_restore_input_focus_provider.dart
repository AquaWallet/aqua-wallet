/// Emits [FocusAction] events based on mnemonic input changes to move focus
/// to the next input field.
///
/// The rule is simple:
/// 1. When the user selects a suggestion ( `isSuggestion == true` ), the focus
///    should automatically move to the next input field â€” provided the next
///    field is still empty.
/// 2. If the current field is the last one **or** the next field already
///    contains text, the current focus is simply cleared.
///
/// Focus is NOT moved when typing a complete word - only when a suggestion
/// is explicitly tapped. This allows users to continue typing or make
/// corrections without losing focus.
///
/// Suggestions are validated against the word list to ensure they are valid
/// BIP-39 words before triggering auto-focus.
